A comprehensive Python project that implements and compares the performance of various clustering algorithms on synthetic datasets generated using `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs`.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of fundamental and advanced clustering techniques to identify groups and patterns within multidimensional synthetic data. It serves as an excellent educational resource for understanding how different clustering algorithms behave under controlled conditions.
